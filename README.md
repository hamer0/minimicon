# React Vite

This project it a skeleton of **React** and **Vite** (and **Typescript**)! It was created to ensure a clean slate, with production grade features such as properly configured **eslint**, using **Vite** and **SWC** for a faster development experience and hot reloads. **Vite** also uses **Rollup** as a bundler, which is much more efficient than standard **Webpack**.

## Commands

- npm start - run your project in development mode
- npm run lint - check your project for any warnings via **eslint**
- npm run format - format your project using **prettier**
- npm run build - build your project
- npm run preview - test your built project

## Types folder

The **tsconfig.json** is already set up to handle types from a `@types` folder inside the `src` directory.
